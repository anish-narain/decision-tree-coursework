# Machine Learning Decision Tree Coursework 1
## Summary 
This repository shows the visualisation and evaluation of a given clean and noisy data set. The dataset presents a value of wifi strength from 7 different wifi signals which can then be used to identify which, of 4 rooms, a person is in. Using decision trees and evalusation metrics we were able to determine the efficiency of our classification and evalusation model in python. We used libaries such as, numPy and matplotlib in order to execute calculations and visulaise the tree.

## Project Setup
To set up our project environment and libaries we used the following commands, having downloaded the requirements.txt file:

```
$ cd your_project_directory 
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
(venv) $ pip install --upgrade pip
(venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
(venv) $ python3 -c "import numpy as np; import torch; print(np); print(torch)"
```
